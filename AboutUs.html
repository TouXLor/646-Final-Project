        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>
          In the Spring of 2017, Principal Founder Kevin Nguyen had a dream to
          bring about a new opportunity for Asian American men on campus. He
          desired to leave behind a positive legacy through a unique brotherhood
          that defied the status quo. He also recognized that the University of
          Wisconsin-Madison lacked opportunities for Asian American men to find
          a healthy Greek life experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Determined to create that space, Kevin recruited a group of men who
          shared his vision: Dustin Nguyen, Timothy Tran, Daniel King, David Ho,
          Justyn Nguyen, Ly Hoang, Thang Nguyen, and Nawang Singhe. Together,
          they founded SOULL — Strength, Opportunity, Unity, Leadership, and
          Love — using these values to guide their mission and future members.
        </p>

        <p>
          By Fall 2017, SOULL had grown with the additions of Brian Leung,
          Travis Dao, Hong Nhan, Nawal Dua, and Neehar Namjoshi. Their goal was
          to provide a platform for Asian American men to have a voice on campus
          and a safe, inclusive space to foster a new kind of brotherhood. Their
          efforts paid off when they were officially accepted into the
          Multicultural Greek Council on November 14, 2017.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Spring 2018, they pursued the dream of joining a larger national
          organization. After months of dedication and hard work, they were
          officially recognized as the Chosen Charters of the 67th Chapter of
          Lambda Phi Epsilon International Fraternity, Inc. on April 15, 2018.

        <h2>Founders of Lambda Phi Epsilon (1981 - UCLA)</h2>
        <p>
          Lambda Phi Epsilon was founded on February 25, 1981, by a group of
          nineteen dedicated men on the campus of the University of California
          at Los Angeles. The goal of the founders was to transcend the
          limitations to which traditional Asian American organizations were
          subject. While traditional Asian campus organizations were often split
          along lines of national origins, the founders sought an organization
          that drew its membership equally from the different segments of the
          Asian American community. Their vision was that the members would
          eventually become the leaders of their respective communities and
          bridge the gaps fragmenting the Asian American community through their
          affiliation with a common organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          The greatest hurdle in reaching this goal, however, was the lack of
          continuity among the memberships inherent in traditional Asian campus
          organizations. At best, student associates provided a circle of
          friends spanning the years of undergraduate study – and at worst – a
          group of familiar strangers encountered during periodic social
          functions. The yearly turnover of most organizations’ officers made it
          extremely difficult to pursue any extended project as each new officer
          core set its own agenda. The founders’ solution to this dilemma was
          the adoption of a fraternal social structure. By forming Lambda Phi
          Epsilon as a new Asian American fraternity, the founders hoped to set
          new standards of excellence for Asian social organizations. The
          founders not only formed strong bonds of brotherhood with each other
          during their undergraduate experience, they also made a commitment to
          the organization as alumni even after graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 1989, Lambda Phi Epsilon had chapters on five campuses in
          California and one in Texas. The first National Conference at Irvine
          established a national governing body to coordinate the individual
          chapters’ efforts. The conference also saw the adoption of a national
          philanthropy and the implementation of a national expansion policy.
          With the admission to the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) on
          September 8, 1990, Lambda Phi Epsilon became the first national Asian
          American fraternity recognized by the NIC. Today, Lambda Phi Epsilon
          continues to expand across the United States and has become the
          largest and fastest growing Asian American fraternity in the country.
