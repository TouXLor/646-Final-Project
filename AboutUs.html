        <p class="page-content__text">
          In the Spring of 2017, Principal Founder Kevin Nguyen had a dream to bring about a new opportunity for 
          Asian American men on campus. He desired to leave behind a positive legacy on this campus through a 
          unique brotherhood that defied the status quo. In addition, he recognized that the University of 
          Wisconsin-Madison lacked opportunities for Asian American men to find a healthy Greek life experience.
        </p>
        <p class="page-content__text">Deciding that this was the right time to pursue unchartered territory, he recruited a group of men 
          who shared his ambitions and goals. Together with Dustin Nguyen, Timothy Tran, Daniel King, David Ho,
          Justyn Nguyen, Ly Hoang, Thang Nguyen, and Nawang Singhe they founded the organization SOULL (Strength, Opportunity, Unity, Leadership, Love). They chose their values as guiding principles for what they wanted to see in themselves and future members. In the Fall of 2017, SOULL solidified itself as an interest group with the addition of Brian Leung, Travis Dao, Hong Nhan, Nawal Dua, and Neehar Namjoshi. As SOULL their ultimate goal was to provide another platform for Asian American men to have a voice on this campus as well as a safe and inclusive space to foster a new kind of brotherhood. In an effort to be recognized by the University, these fourteen men worked diligently to earn acceptance into the Multicultural Greek Council. They were accepted on November 14, 2017.
          </p>
          <p class="page-content__text">In the Spring of 2018, these men embarked on a new journey to bring another Asian-Interest fraternity 
            to campus. Guided by their passions and commitment to brotherhood, these fourteen men sacrificed blood,
            sweat, and tears to earn their right into the Fraternity. They were once known as SOULL, but as of 
            April 15, 2018 they are forever recognized as the Chosen Charters of the 67th Chapter of Lambda Phi 
            Epsilon International Fraternity, Inc.</p>
