      <h2>National Marrow Donor Program</h2>
      <p>
        Lambda Phi Epsilon is dedicated to serving the community and making a
        positive impact through various philanthropic efforts. Our primary focus
        is on the National Marrow Donor Program, where we work tirelessly to
        raise awareness and encourage individuals to become bone marrow donors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lambda Phi Epsilon works with the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)
        to save the lives of patients requiring bone marrow transplants.
        Additionally, the fraternity promotes awareness for leukemia and other
        blood disorders. Individuals who suffer from these types of illnesses
        depend on donors with similar ethnic backgrounds to find compatible bone
        marrow matches. Thus, the fraternity aims to register as many committed
        donors to the cause through local “Be the Match” campaigns to increase
        the chances for patients to find a lifesaving donor.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        In 1995, Evan Chen, a member of Theta Chapter at Stanford University,
        was diagnosed with leukemia. Their chapter, along with Evan’s friends,
        organized a joint effort to find a bone marrow donor. What resulted was
        the largest bone marrow typing drive in the history of the NMDP and
        Asian American Donor Program (AADP). In a matter of days, over two
        thousand people were typed into the bone marrow registry. A match was
        eventually found for Evan, but unfortunately by that time the disease
        had taken its toll on him and he passed away in 1996. In Evan’s memory,
        the national philanthropy for Lambda Phi Epsilon was established and the
        fraternity has been working with the organization from that point
        forward.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Every Lambda Phi Epsilon chapter works with non-profit organizations
        such as AADP, Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches, and the Cammy Lee
        Leukemia Foundation to hold marrow-typing drives on their campuses to
        encourage Asians and other minorities to register as committed bone
        marrow/stem cell donors. Since the fraternity’s inception, Lambda Phi
        Epsilon has educated thousands of donors to commit to saving the life of
        a patient in need.
